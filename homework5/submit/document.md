I use PID algorithm to control the speed and the direction, respectively. For speed, if the current speed is less than $5$m/s, the target speed will be set such value, and if the vehicle is close to the destination, the target speed is set smaller according to the distance to the destination. For direction, first I search the route to the destination, and use the next 10th point to direct my car.
